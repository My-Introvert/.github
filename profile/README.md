# MY INTROVERT
App solutions for Introverts - Product Base Capstone (Bangkit 2023 Batch 1)\
Our team consists of 7 people, where our team has an idea to make a special application to help introverts, where we see a lot of blockers for introverts but not many are aware of this, and there is no special application created to deal with this problem, where in our Project we focus on "Help Improve Social Skills and Mental Health" for Introverts.\

## Excecutive Summary / Abstract :
Our idea is to make a special Application to help Introverts, where we see a lot of Blockers for Introverts but not many are aware of this, and there is no specific Application made to deal with this problem, which in our Project Today we focus on "Helping to Improve Social Skills and Mental Health" for Introverts.

The problem that happens a lot is that in every profession there must be several or many introverts in it, especially in the IT field there are very many introverts in it, the biggest problem is that every introvert seems to have their own world, there are other characters that introverts have so that makes introverts when in Public there are a few problems or there is a Blocker for Introverts.

From the results of our observations, there are several common blockers or problems that many introverts have, such as difficulty in public speaking, being too over looking at things, not liking crowds, difficult being a leader, and many more.

According to existing research, there are 2 general characteristics that humans have, namely introverts and extroverts, where specifically for introverts there are many things or traits outside of the usual humans, therefore we here want to make solutions to problems faced by introverts, because some of the members In our team there are introverts and we all experience everything that happens, and we hope that introverts can still be normal humans in general by being classy introverts.

## Project Scope & Deliverables :
"My Introvert" is the name of the Application that we will build, which we have explained in the Project Summary, where we use this App to help Introverts from weaknesses that Introverts have, this App will be based on Mobile Interfaces, which is supported by Back-End based Web, and will implement Machine Learning Technology in it, to help us create special features in our App later, where we will describe the following features that will be in our Application :
1. Social Skills Assessment : Applications can use Machine Learning technology to analyze user answers in tests or quizzes and provide recommendations based on the results of the analysis.
2. Content Personalization : Applications can use Machine Learning technology to study user preferences and needs, so that applications can provide recommendations and content that are more suited to individual needs.
3. Personal Coaching Sessions : Applications can use Machine Learning technology to analyze user data, such as behavior and preferences, so that they can provide more personalized recommendations in coaching sessions.
4. Social Skills Training : Apps can provide interactive exercises and simulations to help users learn certain social skills, such as how to talk to strangers or how to communicate properly.
5. Discussion Forums : Applications can provide forums or chat rooms for users who want to discuss and exchange information about their experiences in improving social skills and mental health.
6. Public Speaking Training : Applications can provide training and simulations to help users improve their skills in public speaking.
